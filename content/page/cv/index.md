I have a decade of experience in several roles, from consultant to freelancer and teacher. 

**Teaching** allows me to be in touch with the strategic requirements of the market, while the work I do in **Agency** gives me the management skills to achievement the goals of the brands I work with. These two vectors come together in the work I do as a freelance, where I hone my technical skills and follow projects from concept to conclusion.

# Skills and Competencies

The areas I have worked in allowed me to one my Communication and Problem Solving Skills. In recent years I have been involved in roles that required project management and leadership of a team. This experience helped me become more organised and focused on the goal of the projects I'm in.

What makes me stand out from my peers is my capacity to grasp technical issues and requirements and offer solutions. This comes as a result of my interest for technology and hobby as a Fullstack developer.

These technical skills and competencies, with no formal training, can be see on my blog at https://brunoamaral.eu

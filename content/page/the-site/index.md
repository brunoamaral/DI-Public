<p>This site is both a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JkIs37a2JE">small tribute to Jamiroquai</a> and a way to explain my divergence of interests and fascinations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/114597-when-we-change-the-way-we-communicate-we-change-society">The way technology is changing our way of communicating and the way society is shaped fascinates me</a>. Looking and working at the far horizon of these changes can be mistaken for insanity. If that is the case, I am insane and perfectly ok with it.</p><img src="tools-of-the-trade.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="tools of the trade : Geek, Consultant">
<p>This place on the web is my playground where I want to do a bit of show and tell. It is where I want to share with you somethings I have done and that you can do as well or even better. Instructions are included for that reason.</p>
<p>This playground has a jungle gym of words and ideas that vary from insightful to useless. At the very least I hope to entertain and drive you to question on your own.</p>
<p>Even though I work as a consultant for Marketing and Digital Strategy, don't let that mislead you. There is a reason why this playground doesn't have a big sign saying 'Marketing posts'.</p>

<p>Pay attention to two things. One is that I enjoy playing with words. You will find many obscure references, some in plain sight others not so much. The other is that I have used photos from very good photographers and made sure to keep links to their work so you can discover more.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>You and me are a lot alike. We have a day job, routines, and responsibilities. And I like to write stuff for this magazine, I really do. It started out as a simple and bland blog. It grew and today is something that I am proud of.</strong></p>

Right now, it's where I write the CryptoNovel puzzle game. It demands more than the usual blog post and is free for everyone to read and play. And I want to keep it that way. However, this all takes resources. The website hosting alone ammounts to 180€ per year.

So I have decided to register on Patreon and came up with a number of ways you can support the effort and get something back for it.

<p>Your pledge will only be processed when and if I publish a long form and in-depth article, like the ones bellow, or a new chapter of Crypto.</p>

<h4 class="title">Donation</h4>

If you would prefer to offer a one time donation instead, you can. Click the Paypal button. 

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" />
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="AXWFQJCEPSFNL" />
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif" border="0" name="submit" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" alt="Donate with PayPal button" />
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_PT/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" />
</form>


<p>If you don't feel like commiting to a monetary pledge that is fine, there are other ways you can show support. One of which is to share it with your friends.</p>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-content-sm-between flex-wrap ">

<a class="btn btn-twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=brunoamaral&text=Digital%20Insanity%20Magazine&url=https://brunoamaral.eu&hashtags=creativity,culture,geek">
<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>&nbsp;Tweet</a>

<a class="btn btn-success " href="https://wa.me/?text=https://brunoamaral.eu/">
<i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i>&nbsp;Send on WhatsApp</a>

</div>

Another one, is to [drop me a line and say you use the site and what you like about it](/page/contact/). It helps me find out what works and why, making it better for everyone.

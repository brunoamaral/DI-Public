What I really like about technology, is that it can bring people together. This blog is my way to reach out and share this with you. The ideas and opinions expressed are of course my own, unless stated otherwise.

I am a Communication Strategis at ClubJudgeÂ and during my spare time I try to find small projects where to bring people together.

And I tinker with programming every now and then, both as a way to get my own communication plans off the ground, to better understand what it takes to deploy a digital communication plan and to keep learning.

You can find some of these projects over at <a href="/the-lab">The Lab</a>.

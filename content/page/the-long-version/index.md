<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  This story starts in Portugal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  Before moving on to high school, if you asked anyone they would tell you that I would be taking up computer sciences. Fortunately, that did not happen.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  I do love technology, but felt that a Humanities course was a preferable route. Later, that decision took me to a Media Studies course and a specialization in Public Relations. It was here that what began as a mild choice turned into a passion.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  After working with a psychology association and taking a teaching course, I spent a year working with Fujitsu Services. By then I was already one of the few Portuguese PR Bloggers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  It was around this time that I took the challenge of a Master Degree in Public Relations and Strategic Management and later the endeavour of a dissertation on <a href="/values-systems/">values systems</a>, social media and Online PR.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  The result of these choices led me to the <a href="https://publicsphere.typepad.com/euroblog2008/">Euprera EuroBlog2008 Symposium</a>, on <em>Social media and the future of PR: New ideas, new research, new business. </em>Two days that influenced my view of public relations henceforth.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  2009 began with three months teaching public relations in Cape Verde, theory, practice and online communication. It was during this time that I helped write <a href="https://www.bledcom.com/uploads/papers2009/A-proof-of-concept-for-automated-discourse-analysis-in-support-of-identification-of-relationship-building-in-blogs.doc">A proof of concept for automated discourse analysis in support of identification of relationship building in blogs</a>, which was later<a href="https://www.bledcom.com/uploads/papers2009/A-proof-of-concept.ppt">presented at BledCom.</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  Today, my skills include Social Media and Public Relations Strategy, to Search Engine Optimization, creation of measurement dashboards, and online PR research to consulting in building and integrating online communication platforms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  Thus helping to apply communication technology to organizational goals in the most effective and efficient way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  What I learned in all this?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">
  Skill is not enough to practice a discipline, it takes a passion.

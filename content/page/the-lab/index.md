**[The Untitled Series][1]** was a weekend project where I succeeded to deploy a full blog in less than 1 hour. It lacks any branding or elaborate design, but it is made out of static files and therefore a small team could customise it in a matter of minutes. This sort of solution is ideal for Crisis Communication or small projects with low budgets. The Untitled Series is where I store what I write for fun, small texts and short stories, mostly in portuguese. It is powered by [Jekyll][2], in case you are wondering.

**[Mobile Profile][3]** makes your business cards better. It lets you register a profile and gives you a QR Code so others can access it and use your contact details with a few taps. With it, you can make sure that the information on your business card is always up to date because you can edit your email, telephone and other details. It was also the first time where I attempted to build something made for mobile screens, using the [Twitter Bootstrap framework][4].

**A Different Perspective** is not just my blog, it is a collaboration in personal branding with [Diana Costa][5]. It was rebuilt with a new editorial line, a full graphic identity and a design that works across every screen, from mobile to large desktop monitors. The main concern was to make it easy to read and provide an uncluttered user experience. The blog runs on [WordPress][6] and the theme was fully coded by me. (I even learned a bit of javascript in the process.)

[**Cenas Que a Gaja Diz**][7] is written in Portuguese and it got the inspiration from Justin&#8217;s twitter account @[shitmydadsays][8]. It is written in a silent collaboration with [Tânia Rodrigues][9].

**[Natal PT][10]** proved that it is quite easy to engage people across the country with just an afternoon of work. It is an instagram gallery that collects photos using the same hashstag, in this case #natalpt. After letting people know about the gallery, we collected over 300 photos in about 4 weeks. The whole thing started when a sudden rain ruined my plans to enjoy a saturday afternoon.

[**Merry Christmas**][11] is a blog I update just once a year. Around Christmas time I put some work towards creating a different kind of postcard to send to friends and family across the globe. The &#8220;card&#8221; can be a video, a photoshop ilustration or even a whole website. It was only fair I took some time to keep a record of everything I do around Christmas.

One is that the last post dates back to April 3<sup>rd</sup>. The other is that it looks plain and boring, with little or no design.

I never planned to stop blogging for so long and I have a strong belief that blogs will endure. Yet, simply openning up the &#8220;new post&#8221; screen and typing away is not enough for me right now. I want more.

So to go along with the new promise of a post, this blog is getting a new design. But that is not the reason why it looks so plain and boring as it does now. The new design will come built into my personal WordPress Framework, built in [html5][2] thanks to the [[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-587" title="5574548309_15987bb941" src=5574548309_15987bb941.jpeg" alt="Photo by Pedro Moura Pinheiro" width="500" height="500" srcset=5574548309_15987bb941-150x150.jpg 150w,5574548309_15987bb941.jpg 300w,5574548309_15987bb941.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />][1]If you visit this blog you will notice two things.

Only when the new design is in place will this blog see some new features such as the Google+ share button and a greater link between comments and social network services.

What does this have to do with Public Relations? The point of taking the time to build a whole new framework is to make blog templates easier to build and to customize.

Stay tuned and feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments.

Last week Lisbon and specifically the [School of Communication and Media Studies][1], was the stage for the [EUPRERA][2]/Euroblog Spring Symposium. I had the pleasure of playing a small role in the organizing team, with Mafalda Eiró-Gomes, [David Phillips][3] and [Philip Young][4].

[The conference focused on how Public Relations is responding to the challenges of the Internet][5], and with invited speakers such as [Philip Sheldrake][6] and Anne Gregory it was indeed a valuable discussion.

My take is that we have not changed much on the way we practice Public Relations, even though there is indeed quite a lot of opportunities and new tools just waiting to be developed and put to use. This does not refer to blogs, twitter or facebook but to the possibility to rethink a whole organization&#8217;s structure, to try new ways to communicate and ultimately to change society.

It was also a special pleasure to see the Spring Symposium in Lisbon, as it was [the conference that in 2008 had a huge impact on how I think and see PR][7]. For that my gratitude goes to EUPRERA and everyone who makes it the great association it is.

Last but not least, a huge thank you goes to the team at [Nüwa Studio][8] who came up with the amazing website design we used.

Part of the conference also meant a few changes for the Euroblog Study, but more on that later this week.

Over the next few weeks I will be publishing a small series of articles, most of which are the translation to english of previous writings.

The point of these articles is to bring down popular concepts such as &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;, &#8220;Social Media&#8221;, &#8220;Social Web&#8221;, &#8220;Social Networks&#8221; and a number of others. These concepts tend to be misunderstood and misused, as a result Communication Professionals are faced with unrealistic expectations about what they do, how the tools they use work and what results are to be achieved.

Simply put, just because a word is used often it does not mean it is always given the same meaning or evenÂ understood.

First we will look a bit at the evolution of the Internet, and then we will pick up the concepts one by one.

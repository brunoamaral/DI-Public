> Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure he called a kernel. The kernel has three parts: 1) A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.

— José Vicente Ferreira, Docente do ISCSP


> A business strategy is a set of guiding principles that, when communicated and adopted in the organization, generates a desired pattern of decision making. A strategy is therefore about how people throughout the organization should make decisions and allocate resources in order accomplish key objectives.

### Estratégia de Marketing

> "The marketing strategy lays out target markets and the value proposition that will be offered based on an analysis of the best market opportunities." 

(Philip Kotler & Kevin Keller, Marketing Management, Pearson, 14th Edition)

> “An over-riding directional concept that sets out the planned path.” 

(David Aaker and Michael K. Mills, Strategic Market Management, 2001, p. 11)

> "Essentially a formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be and what policies will be needed to carry out these goals." 

(Michael Porter, Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors , NY, Free Press, 1980)

> "The pattern of major objectives, purposes and goals and essential policies and plans for achieving those goals, stated in such a way as to define what business the company is in or is to be in. 

(S. Jain, Marketing Planning and Strategy, 1993)

> "An explicit guide to future behaviour.” 

(Henry Mintzberg, “ Crafting Strategy,” Harvard Business Review, July–August, 1987 pp. 66–74)

> Strategy is "reserved for actions aimed directly at altering the strengths of the enterprise relative to that of its competitors... Perfect strategies are not called for. What counts is... performance relative to competitors.” 

(Kenichi Ohmae, The Mind of the Strategist, 1982, p. 37)

> Strategy formulation is built on "the match between organisational resources and skills and environmental opportunities and risks it faces and the purposes it wishes to accomplish."

## Ter uma Estratégia é poder resolver problemas antes de eles acontecerem

O conceito de estratégia está diluído

- Estratégia de negócio
- Estratégia de Comunicação
- Estratégia de Marketing
- Estratégia de Marca
- Estratégia de Conteúdo

Neste artigo, vamos falar de estratégia de comunicação e não apenas de estratégia marketing. Pq o marketing se concentra no produto, e o conceito de comunicação é mais abrangente. Uma estratégia de comunicação foca-se em estabelecer relações e construir uma comunidade de modo equilibrado com a estratégia de negócio.

Um cliente que nos pede uma estratégia quer, numa primeira abordagem, organizar os esforços de comunicação e apontar para um objectivo concreto que está alinhado com o negócio.

Nós, o que temos de fazer é dar-lhe isso e um pensamento estruturado que lhe permita dar mais liberdade de acção a todas as áreas da empresa.

A estratégia torna-se assim numa ferramenta que dá a qualquer pessoa a liberdade e responsabilidade de agir.

Para isto acontecer é preciso que seja fácil de comunicar ao público interno.

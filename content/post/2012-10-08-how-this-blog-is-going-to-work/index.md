It&#8217;s a blog and it shouldn&#8217;t be hard or complicated, right?

[And it shouldn&#8217;t be boring either][2].

Once in a while you will get a post which is just an image or just a tweet from someone interesting. It may or it may not include a small idea and a bit of context. Later on I will publish a longer article where all that is made into something more concrete for further discussion.

The idea here is to give readers a glimpse of what I am thinking about and a chance for them to &#8220;chip in&#8221; with a comment or opinion they may have which will later be added to the longer post.

Does this make sense?

What would you add or change in all of it?

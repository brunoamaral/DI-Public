I was never a fan of the <a href="https://underscores.me/">Underscores</a>, Automattic\&#8217;s bare bones template. Until last night.

It helped me port a shopify template to wordpress in less than four hours. And the steps were pretty simple:

  * Rendered the liquid template to html;
  * Added the necessary Stylesheets and Javascript to underscores;
  * Fixed a few broken elements;
  * Styled the posts and comments for readability;
  * Had chocolate to celebrate!

The other day, a friend asked me where to listen to [Fado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado) while in Porto. The answer is harder than it seems. Fado began in Lisbon, and students took it with them to the universities in Coimbra. Fado eventually made it's way to Porto.

And instead of searching on Google, I figured the best route was to ask friends from Porto.

And this blew up!

Not satisfied with recommending places for Fado, they began listing other cool things to do and see in Porto. 

**It was only fair to give their hard work the spotlight it deserves, [so I added a page with the list to this blog](/page/beautiful-porto).** The same list is below this blog post, to save you a click.

And, hoping I won't forget anyone, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to that list:

- Bruno Rodrigues
- Hugo Relva
- Nuno Dantas
- Pedro Pinheiro
- Pedro Rebelo
- Rui Oliveira
- Sérgio Bernardino
- Vasco Vasconcelos

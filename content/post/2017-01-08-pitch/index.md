**[This is Pitch.](https://pitch.pt)**

It's a small implementation of a reddit-style site that I put together with [Miguel Albano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malbano), it aims to gather relevant news and best practices for marketing, PR and communications.

This could apply to any number of contexts, yet I feel that the odds of it being relevant increase if we focus on a target group.

Launching now is also not an accident. In a time when we are drowned by fake news and low grade content meant to be consumed quickly, we need filters and sources of up to date information. Facebook is failing this role because it uses an obscure algorithm to measure the relevance of links. 

More than ever, we need human eyes and focused topics to filter what is truly relevant in a given context.

I hope this Pitch will be the one to drive that goal forward.

So with no further delay, I invite you to

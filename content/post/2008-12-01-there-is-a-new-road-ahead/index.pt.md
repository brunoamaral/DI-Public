November the 21st was my last day as a part of Ask Fujitsu, the team that provided the Front Office of Fujitsu Services. After being moved to Portugal in 2007, it later received the award for Best Marketing Team of the Year.

This was due to the implementation of Fujitsu&#8217;s Sense and Respond methodology as well as a great deal of work in improving the customer&#8217;s experience.

More than colleagues, I also left friends behind and I hope our paths cross again.

With them, I learned a lot and for that I am thankful, but now it&#8217;s time for me to look in a new direction and focus on my Master&#8217;s Course. Hopefully this will also mean a more steady flow of posts during the next few weeks at least.

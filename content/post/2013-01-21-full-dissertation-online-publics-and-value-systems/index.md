As promised on my [last post][2], you can now find here [my full dissertation on online Publics and Value Systems][3].

There is also an [executive summary and presentation][4].

If this is something new to you, it can be summed up in a few words. Back in 2009 I presented a dissertation and methodology to identify publics among blogs or any other network of hyperlinks.

This is also linked to what David Phillips calls [The Lisbon Theory][5]. It uses the same definition of Values and of Relationships.

As usual for anything that I make public, your thoughts and comments are more than welcome.

I have now an idea on what direction this blog needs to follow. Taking into account that its content will have to be maintained, that several courses still use it as a reference for Online PR in Portugal.

But before all that comes to be, I have been taking steps to add to the traditional stream of post what I believe is a great insight about Public Relations in Portuguese.

Only after that will I be applying any more changes. I can tell you it will be a good blend of Blogging and Microblogging as well as a display of what I consider to be best practices in Online Public Relations with hopes of reaching a wider audience and at the same time allow for meaningful dialogue.

Please wait just a while longer.

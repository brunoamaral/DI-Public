Leaving home, I must have taken a wrong turn and found myself surrounded by a parade to celebrate the Chinese New Year.

There were several countries from the east represented, and even traditional Portuguese groups were there. With drums blazing, they were the loudest.

Lisbon is rich in expats from  Brazil, Arab countries, former Portuguese colonies, China, Macau, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan and others.

It feels nice to see this as part of the day to day of Lisbon.

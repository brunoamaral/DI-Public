After the whole mess of unclear Terms of Service, [Instagram replies][1]. The whole thing could have been avoided if they had already shed light about what their future ad offering is.

What bugs me is the whole outbreak and deleted accounts on Instagram. Why didn&#8217;t it happen on Facebook as well?

Facebook&#8217;s Terms of Service read:

> For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your [privacy][2] and [application settings][3]: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

This can be read pretty much in the same way as the Terms of Service that Instagram published.

[The New York Times managed to avoid all the hype and outrage and publish a throughout piece about the whole problem][4].

And, were we really expecting Instagram to be free forever without some sort of compromise?

Those that migrated, have they read the Terms of Service on other sites, do they know what business model those new channels work on?

My Instagram account is staying just the way it is. The only thing that will get me to move is if the people I want to share with decide to migrate to another channel.

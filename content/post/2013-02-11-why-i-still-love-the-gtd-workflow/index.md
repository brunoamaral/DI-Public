A few years back we all flocked to the [Getting Things Done method by David Alen][2], and with good reason.

His methodology helps us stay productive and is flexible enough to be applied to a great number of contexts. [The image above is a simple explanation of that methodology][3] and one that stuck to my mind ever since I laid eyes on it.

But it is not bullet proof or all encompassing.

I have been working with [Fullsix Portugal][4] for a year and a half now and during that time I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of brands and organisations. Every single one of them had their software or own method and as is our policy we adjust in any way we can.

Best thing to do is to keep that little flow chart in mind, at least for me. It helps to stay focused amidst a myriad of google documents, proprietary software, documents going back and forth, and meeting memos.

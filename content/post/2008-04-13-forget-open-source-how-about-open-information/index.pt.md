And altough they have produced some great studies on the subject, their most recent flashreport leaves a lot to be desired.

The problem is not just the way the terms &#8220;Blogger-producer&#8221; and &#8220;Blogger-consumer&#8221; are used, leaving an immense grey area. It&#8217;s mostly having a report published in 2008 with data from 2006.

Obercom left this report in the dark for two years. A lot changed since then of course. Enough to make this report useless by now, unless you are mapping the evolution of the web over a long period.

But allow me to broaden the scope and ask: How ethical is it for a research organization to keep information inaccessible?

### Enter Open Information

If there are API (<span>Application Programming Interface) built for services like twitter, why not build an interface for researchers to access raw data and publish their conclusions?</span>

This would just mean having extra care not to divulge private information of people who participate in the research. And the questionnaires already reflect that concern by not asking for a name or any information that might lead to a possible identification.

Still, there is ethical ground to uncover here, but I think that it&#8217;s something worth considering.

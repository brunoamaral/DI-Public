The story goes like this, back in 2013 I borrowed a GoPro camera and took it to see the christmas lights. This year, I decided to extend that idea.

This year's video is here, and right after it is the first one from 2013.

There was so much happening that I decided to keep walking along and gathering a few more bits and pieces of Lisbon. And the odd christmas tree, well, that is mine. Another tradition is that every year I have friends over for dinner and they have to decorate an unusual tree.

Enjoy the madness, and Merry Christmas!

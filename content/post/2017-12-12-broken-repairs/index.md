The idea of repairs is on my mind lately. For a number of reasons that include my health, my day to day, my goals. 

It also includes stuff I have around the house and that I no longer have use for and that have been selling or giving away. Because you see, when you rebuild you should take the opportunity to improve what surrounds you. That sometimes means trimming away what you don't need and that may be useful to others.

And yes, it may lead to a more frugal life.

The idea that our society does not value repairs is not new. it's much easier to buy something new than it is to fix that belt that broke, or those shoes that broke at the heel. 

The japanese have an amazing form of repairs called [Kintsugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi).

[it doesn't erase the past, it turns a page and uses it to bring beauty to what was broken.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XkLfy)

What it does not say, is that repairing things take time. Glue needs to stick, wounds need to heal, and it takes time and dedication. It takes a world of patience. 

But that's part of the return. To gain or keep something that is full of good memories and hidden smiles.

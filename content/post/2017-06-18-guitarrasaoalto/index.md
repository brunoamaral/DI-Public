Working as a freelancer means that you sometimes get to see something grow from small to huge.

Yesterday, I had the feeling I was watching that process happen.

Vasco Dur√£o is the mastermind of [Guitarras ao Alto](https://guitarrasaoalto.pt), a music festival in Alentejo that brings two guitarists together to mix and match their chords, improvise, and stand up for their art.

"Às Páginas Tantas" is the name of a new series of posts I am going to try.

To summarize, every day I will try to write a full page of whatever comes to my mind. Which is why I am not going to translate it or bother to find fancy images to illustrate like the other things I write.

If you're interested, <a href="/story/paginas-tantas">you can find it here, already with the first page</a>.

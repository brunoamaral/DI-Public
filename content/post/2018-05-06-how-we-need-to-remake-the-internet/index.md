Since I read "You are Not a Gadget" that Jaron became a sort of thorn in my side. The good kind of thorn, the kind that challenges our opinion.

The views he expresses in the book are opposite to my sort of technocratic vision. In other settings, he stays true to those views about our lock in to formats, about how technology can impact how we relate with each other.

And he is right.

[The NY Times has a good summary of the book "You Are Not a Gadget".](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/books/15book.html)

In this TED Talk he does it again. Jaron presents his view on how corporations act as behaviour modification empires, and suggests an alternative to the advertising revenue model.

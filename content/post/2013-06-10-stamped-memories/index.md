![passport][1]

I love to travel.

And a while back I renewed my passport and got one of the new eletronic passports which are amazing. You swipe them in the sensor, a machine looks at you and lets you through the border. Quick, simple and easy.

But I miss the stamps.

Those markings were automatic souvenirs and looking at them brought back memories and stories to share.

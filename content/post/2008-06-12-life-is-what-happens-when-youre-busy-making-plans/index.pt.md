Yesterday I realised just how long this blog as been without an update. A friend came to me and asked if something was wrong because the last post dates back to the 6th of May.

But no, there is nothing wrong. The reason why the blog has not been updated is simple: I was forced to drop it&#8217;s priority so I could cope with school and work.

Ironically I now have several ideas for new posts and some surprises underway. One of them is bringing Social Media Cafe to Lisbon. More on that will come soon.

In the meantime, my priority is still my Master&#8217;s and Work. So please bear with me while I sort out more pressing priorities. And subscribe to the rss feed if you would like to know when the updates return.

It won&#8217;t be long now.

Following the bar set high by the first day of the conference, the second and last part of the event lived up to expectations.

New Zealand contributed with an interesting perspective and explanation of the Maori Party&#8217;s campaign. Other presentations focused more on cultural aspects as well as in the analysis of discourse.

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1736" title="bledcom" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bledcom1-300x171.png" alt="bledcom" width="300" height="171" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bledcom1-300x171.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bledcom1-1024x585.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bledcom1-624x356.png 624w, /wp-content/uploads/2009/07/bledcom1.png 1196w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]This is where David Phillips and I had a chance to participate.

We presented our paper on the analysis of online discourse and at the last minute thought about analysing the hyperlink network around [BledCom.com][2].

And so we did.

Both the network analysis and the semantic analysis showed to be in tune with the spirit of the conference. As [David Phillips explains,][3] it&#8217;s not about the words we use the most, but the concepts present along the discourse.

This example of real time analysis allows for an up to the minute monitoring of a public relations strategy as well as an initial assessment on publics&#8217; values. And we are just looking at the tip of the iceberg.

<p class="note">
  <em>last but not least, I would like to thank everyone who took a part in organizing the conference. Your effort did not go unnoticed.</em>

I was going to write a long list of how the world is messed up. The United States, Venezuela, Brazil, almost every country in Africa, and an opaque view of whatever is happening in Asia.

It goes from economic crisis, to political conspiracies to influence elections. The latest? [Taking advantage of terrorism](http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2018/07/02/comment-paris-alimente-la-repression-en-egypte_1663288).

> Dans une synthÃ¨se fournie publiÃ©e ce lundi, quatre ONG, dont la FIDH, font lâ€™Ã©tat des lieux du commerce florissant dâ€™armement et de technologies de surveillance de la France vers lâ€™Egypte, oÃ¹ les violations des droits humains sâ€™aggravent.

And when you would think that the European Union would be a bastion of hope, they go ahead and propose a directive that will hinder freedom of speech.

They want Censorship Machines monitoring what we upload to the Internet, to protect copyright. There are a lot of things wrong with this, one of which is that once these filters are in place, odds are that they will be used for wider forms of censorship.

And it's not just the freedom of speech in Europe that is at risk. These things always spread and ripple to other countries.

[And remember the Arab Spring?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring). In any of these situations, the mere existance of Censorship Machines would be a threat to freedom and to protesters.

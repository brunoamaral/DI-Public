Even though Lanyrd is such a great resources to find events in Lisbon, the truth is that the teams organising conferences or presentations around social media forget to use these tools. If you don&#8217;t believe me, [see for yourself][1].

So when a friend asked me about such conferences I was left pretty much speechless. But I figured it was an easy fix.

In yet another night plagued by insomnia I read up on [Sheetsee.js by Jessica Lord][2]. 45 minutes later I had built a list of Social Media Events powered by a Google Form and the corresponding Spreadsheet.

[You can find it here][3]. Please feel free to add to the list as well!

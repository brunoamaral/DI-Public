This year kicked off pretty fast. In fact, more than half of my life changed in 45 days and I am still trying to figure out what stayed the same.

<a title="Two great years and more to come" href="/two-great-years-and-more-to-come/">I was working with Fullsix for over 2 and a half years as a social media consultant</a>. And during the time I stayed there I learned quite a lot. Yet there is always that time when you need new challenges and to move away from your comfort zone.

So when the opportunity came up to work with Webnographer, it was pretty hard to resist. Webnographer helps companies understand online user behaviour with a solid scientific method and a set of User Experience and Usability tools. And being a small team means I will work in UX projects and also have the opportunity to use my skills as a communication consultant from within the organisation.

This is going to be an amazing adventure and I am sure I will have much more to share in the coming days. Stay tuned.

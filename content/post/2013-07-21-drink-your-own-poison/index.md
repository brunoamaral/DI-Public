[A friend of mine used to say that I drink my own poison, and that it is a good thing][1].

And the other day, in tune with this and [my participation in BledCom][2], Wired published an article titled &#8220;[If Politicians Had to Debug Laws Like Software, Theyâ€™d Fix the Bugs][3]&#8220;.

It comes down to this, programmers force themselves to use the software they build in order to better identify bugs and come up with solutions faster, it is called Dogfooding.

Applied to politicians, making them deal with the same conditions they impose on us would be a path towards a better society. It is funny, the article does not even question if politicians get special treatment, it is a given.

Story time, come sit by the fire and hear the tale of 143 million dollars.

The founder of Quadriga, a company that trades CryptoCoins, died. With him, the keys for 6 bitcoin wallets were lost.

[Checking the public ledger showed that those wallets were empty.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-01/quadriga-has-6-cold-wallets-but-they-don-t-hold-any-crypto?fbclid=IwAR0-ntkZN6fr6_YRri5AvqLPQgan1BgnOzLdWfYPVg6Gr8_iE3KHBEpPU7c)

This left clients asking if Gerald Cotten, the founder, is actually dead. This is already a pretty juicy conspiracy theory. And it gets better.

[Another company, Kraken, is offering a reward of 100k to anyone who can find the missing money.](https://www.kraken.com/learn/podcast?kec=9SG3XLAR3msVQQ#episode3)

This feels like a marketing stunt. Either way, anyone with half a brain, a laptop, and too much free time is sure to jump in the bandwagon for a while.

I don't know about you, but I'm going make popcorn and enjoy the show.

Translated from: https://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/saudade

Ask any portuguese, he will tell you that _saudade_ is something _very portuguese_ and that _can't be described._

Bullshit. 

If you let the person keep talking they may go on to talk about the discoveries and women were left behind, missing the men who had gone out to sea.

Maybe, but that's not the whole story.

They didn't all go in search of new worlds, some were fishermen.

Exchange a few more words and the person will link it to _Fado_, how that traditional portugueses genre embodies _saudade_ like it was a rare gem. Not all true.

In Brazil and Cape Verde, and other parts of the world, other genres exist that bring with them that bitter-sweet taste of _saudade_.

And everyone has their own definition and way of explaining.

I once heard the sentence "_Saudade is cleaning up the room of a dead son or daughter_".

Such grief, and dismay, and darkness. 

I do agree that _saudade_ exists with a mix of good memories and sort of unpleasant present. 

For me, _saudade_ is a cup of coffee once shared with friends and family. 

Make your favorite kind of coffee, or tea. Alone. Take your time to make it.

Go sit down wherever you feel like. Relax and let it sink in. With whom do you enjoy having coffee? Who was the last friend you shared a cup with, in a rush or taking it easy?

Was the cup you are holding the same as that time? Does the aroma bring back those good memories?

That is _saudade_ and that is not exclusive to Portugal or any other part of the world.

And I am probably being called an heretic for shattering that barrier that gave the Portuguese something _only they own_.

To that, I can only say: There is more to life than owning a melancholic feeling guys.

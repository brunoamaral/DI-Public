I had a shock when I realized that I begun writting the new chapter of the CryptoNovel in February 2018. But I know very well why it took so long to write and programme.

It started as a simple idea, to give it a feel of a real dialogue happening today. And I did that in a way meant to convey the anxiety and frustration of trying to talk with someone and getting information out of them.

[I am very happy with the result and have already shared it with Patrons, they get early access](https://www.patreon.com/brunoamaral). In the end of July the new chapter will be published for everyone. 

<h4 class="title">What is the CryptoNovel ?</h4>

It's a literary adventure, and for sure my best and biggest creativity project ever. It acts like a game where you have to unlock each chapter by solving puzzles.

Someone over at Socialbakers is going to have to explain this to me very well.

[Ben Harper published an article where he shows that content reach grew 29% among teens (13â€“24)][1].

Content Reach and Active users are two different things altogether. Any website can lose active users and still see the content reach or time spent online grow as long as a segment of its users becomes more active.

Also, the data presented is segmented only by age. Other countries may have seen a sharp decrease or even have seen teens use Facebook more.

This does not mean the conclusion is wrong, I just don&#8217;t agree with the way it was reached and feel it is questionable.

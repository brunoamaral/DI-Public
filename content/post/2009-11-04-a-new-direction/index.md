This is, I hope, the post you have been waiting for.

This blog well no longer be updated and instead will serve as a repository of information, to reflect this the frontpage will be changed to focus on search, discovery and sharing.

But this does not mean I will stop blogging.

You can find the new blog over at [A Different Perspective — Public Relations and Strategic Management][1]. But do not count on fast and frequent updates, [there is a world of twitter][2] out there just for that. Instead, I hope to use the new blog to publish more substantial and in-depth articles.

So drop by, update your rss reader with the new feed and feel free to let me know what you think.

There is a corner of the street where I work at that is always full of posters. It got to the point that I am not sure if the wall is holding up the posters or the other way around.

It makes you wonder if this way of communication even works.

For me it works, I have noticed concerts being announced and went as far as taking out my phone, buying a ticket and moving on with my life. Two months later my calendar beeped saying I had a concert the next weekend.

And this last week I noticed a nice set of posters, all for the same party.

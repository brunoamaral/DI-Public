I have been putting together the loose bits and pieces of this blog into the [archive page](/archives), articles and posts **dating back to 2005**. Earlier stuff from 2004 has been lost long ago.

In total, **2 378** different posts. Not including their respective translations and the content that I have chosen to keep as drafts or unlisted parts of this website. Instagram photos that I have imported account for **1 495** pages.

Moving this content from the old blog also meant setting up **654** redirects to avoid broken links, and setting up a new update process on Disqus to make sure old comments are also migrated.

Because this is a reflection of who I am and how I have grown up. It's a diary in more ways than one. It's also my way of sharing and trying to build for the sort of society and web that I want to be widespread.

## A word of advice, own your content

Blogspot, Tumblr, Facebook and Flickr. Every service that does not charge to host our content is a weak spot. If they disappear, our content may go with them. At least here, I am free to host it, share it without having to abide to what is considered proper, and I am responsible for what I write and show. 

As an example, an [illustrator I follow on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cara.trancada/) had one of her drawings reported and removed because it was too explicit. [You can click here if you want to see it](images/cara-trancada-procrastination.jpg). This way I can share it with you, and you know straight up that it is questionable by Instagram's standards. 

This being my own website, I am personally responsible for what I publish and its effects. Today this is important, even more than when I started blogging back in 2005.

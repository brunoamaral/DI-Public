<p>This documentary was a part of IndieLisboa, the independent film festival and I got to see it sunday, 12<sup>th</sup>. It's a work by Amaya Sumpsy, Catarina Alves Costa, Carlos Lima, Joana Lucas, Raquel Carvalheira, and Teresa Costa.

<p>And for some reason, this was the third dot in a sequence of links and articles I came across with interesting insights on Religion.</p>

The day after viewing the film, this article on [Open Culture](https://www.openculture.com) showed up on my RSS reader (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rss+readers&oq=rss+readers">Yes, that's still a thing</a>). It's the best summary I have seen so far about religion across the world.

<h3 class="title">Where does religion come from?</h3>

This episode of Hidden Brain tries to answer this question and is able to approach it with both a strong sociology basis and a great deal of respect for people's beliefs.

At the [NEXT Service Design Conference in Berlin][1], [Pedro Custódio][2] made a very strong case on why [Experience is the new product][3].

He&#8217;s going to share the transcript of his presentation, but in the meantime there is a nice summary in his blog or watch the Slideshare embedded here.

First, I do agree with the idea but there are two comments I can&#8217;t overlook.

Number one is that a good Experience means different things to different people, to different Publics around the organization.

And two, to what extent is the concept of Experience akin to Relationship? We must ask the question because some of the aspects of researching what consumers want/need are in fact used by Public Relations departments.

I had forgotten just how amazing this city is. I had forgotten how much I love the poetry on the walls, the ceramic tiles with messages hidden in plain sight, the charming little places waiting around the corner.

When you&#8217;re distracted, it will surprise you in the most&nbsp;delightful&nbsp;way a city can.

last night, when I was walking in Alfama I ended up sidetracked by a friend I ran into. Seems there is a small art association that makes the best of our weather by&nbsp;organizing an outdoor cinema and that day they were airing &#8220;[Roman Holiday][2]&#8220;.

As if that wasn&#8217;t enough for a great surprise, we ended up in a small cape verdean restaurant for drinks. [And that brought back some memories][3].

Heading back, some kids had found a way to set up a LCD screen and a game console so they could play together.

I had forgotten about these little surprises, and worst of all I have neglected to share them with everyone else. That is going to change.

Made it to Bled after a trip that proved to be longer than expected.

And so far I most say that the choice of subject for the conference was perfect — Culture and Public Relations.

It was interesting to listen to perspectives on how culture changes Public Relations from Hong Kong to Germany, no matter what area we are talking about — Lobby, Stakeholder Management, Political Communication and more.

Such presentations do more than just spark curiosity, they make me re-think what I know about Public Relations in a broader scale. Due to the different values that help make up each culture practices and strategy need to be re-thought.

Each presentation can also serve to point out to a need to understand values systems and how they influence relationships as being the challenge for practitioners.

Cannot wait to see how tomorrow will turn out to be.

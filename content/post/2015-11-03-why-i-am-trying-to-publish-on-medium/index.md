I have been pushing myself to write more and there are two things keeping me from the goal of 1 good article a week.

One is that I want to share content that is meaningful, that brings the reader something they can use in their work or in their personal day-to-day tasks.

The other, that it is getting harder and harder to drive readers to this blog.

The Social Media landscape looks like it is going through a lot of changes. [The Buffer team shared some of their insight on this on a recent blog post][1]. [The amount of content we produce keeps growing and filters are failing][2].

Medium offers a new way of organising and suggesting content and for long I have been meaning to give it a try.

What tipped the scales and made me publish an article there was actually a conversation between the team and [Mike Monteiro][3]. Mike asked a question and pointed out an issue he sees in the current design.

**Update: Mike's tweet with the ID 659047324895703040 as since been removed.**

What followed was an healthy discussion and a first step in Mike lending a hand with his expertise.

That&#8217;s what won my trust. Being transparent, working on building something and listening to what users are saying.

If you want to read my first contribution to Medium, it&#8217;s just a click away.

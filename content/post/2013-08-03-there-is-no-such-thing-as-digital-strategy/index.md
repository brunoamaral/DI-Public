[Budd Caddell][1] has an interesting presentation on Digital Strategy 101 that you can see above.

If you are looking to a way to provide your company or your clients with a solid method for digital communication, then this is surely worth your time.

My only critique is that Budd&#8217;s definition of strategy does not fit the common taxonomy of the concepts of strategy and plan. This is something I began by talking about when [my research on strategy began][2].

> First, lets please agree on one premise: Strategy is about long term thinking, a Plan is the way you assemble tactics to meet a specific objective in short or medium term.

Budd&#8217;s definition starts off with:

> A digital strategy is a plan to accomplish something with the benefit of digital tools.

He breaks this down brilliantly and explains a great perspective on how to look at a brand&#8217;s digital planning. Right now, I would suggest a definition more on the lines of :

> A strategy is a long term thinking, with objectives and associated resources to reach them, and a digital plan is a set of tactics to accomplish objectives with the benefit of digital tools and channels.

At this point I need to take charge of my own shortcoming on proposing a definition of &#8220;Communication Strategy&#8221;. This concept will have to be applicable to both online and offline communication, otherwise it won&#8217;t be any good to me or anyone else.Â Budd&#8217;s slide deck did raise a few questions and showed a few solutions that may be interesting towards that objective.

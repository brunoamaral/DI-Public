Can someone tell me when and why we stopped putting work in fixing things?

This is the question in my mind for quite sometime now, for a million of reasons.

But let's go back to another time in my life, when I got a new job and, for the first time, could actually come home and have some time to myself. And I do mean for the first time. 

You see, I have been working for a decade, and in all that time things weren't easy. Work didn't pay as much as I needed, so I worked freelance also. I published papers and participated in conferences to try to improve my reputation and find a better job. I did what I could to help my family, when I could. 

Everyday felt like sink or swim. And If I kept afloat, I owe it to myself and to a handful of people that were there for me and that helped me find freelance work. Others helped me keep my head clear enough to handle the stress. 

And now, it's ... weird. Now I get home and finally relax. I finally think about what book I want to read, what show I want to binge watch. I even picked up learning chess and I'm still a lousy player after completing all the lessons.

But, I get to relax. Calm Down.

You're probably thinking: _Great! I wish I could do that!_ Yes, I wish you could do that too. Then you wouldn't find it strange when I say it's not all that great.

For starters, this isn't a one time thing. It's a long run. And it changes everything. It makes me think about what I want to be doing in a few years. It also makes me wonder about how much I have been drifting and lost.

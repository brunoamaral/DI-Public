As some of you are aware, part of this blog is dedicated to the issue of Public Relations and Values Systems. If you search for it, or look at the [Values Systems category][1], you will find a few posts about the theme.

Simply put, my dissertation puts into question what are publics and how we can identify publics online. This theoric basis is made complete with a case study using the website for the [British Olympic Association][2]. There is an [executive summary available as well][3], and you can find the [presentation on slideshare][4].

With a bit of extra work I believe that my research could be made into part of an Online Communication Course.

Recently I have been giving some serious thought in making the whole dissertation available. The problem is &#8220;How&#8221;.Â For personal and professional reasons I don&#8217;t feel I can afford to simply share the file on the blog for all to read and use.

But I don&#8217;t have a publisher interested on my work and I have never really looked into self-publishing options.

The reason for this post is to know two things:

  * If you are a PR professional / academic, looking at the executive summary of the book would you buy it? And if so, is it something that you might recommend to others?
  * If you have any experience with self-publishing services, would you mind sharing it so I know where to begin?

This time I can\&#8217;t skip classes.

The school where I graduated invited me to be part of a Post-Graduate course on <a href="https://www.d-motions.com/">Strategic Communication</a>. Specifically, I am going to teach about Reputation and Crisis Management.

It\&#8217;s a nice switch of pace, it means going back to the old blog and the old books, dust them off and see how much I can use and how much needs to be updated.

And my feeling from it, is that the school also evolved a great deal. In the past most of my teachers were academics and today I see the course also includes a lot of professionals. A <a href="https://www.estudiojoaocampos.com/pt/estudio">Creative Director</a>, professionals from Communication Agencies like <a href="https://inforpress.pt/">Inforpress</a> and <a href="https://www.comon.pt/">ComOn</a>.

This is also the opportunity to try something different. The course starts in October and until then I will share on the blog as much as I can. <a href="https://www.somewhere.com/brunoamaral">Maybe I can even put my account on Somewhere to good use</a>.

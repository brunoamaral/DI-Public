The perfect tattoo is subjective. And this isn't about finding a set of rules a person should follow, it's more a description of my search for the right design, the exact concept.

And it all starts with the **concept.** A person's tattoo is a representation of culture and values and the concept should tie it down perfectly. Even if you have a good concept, a good idea, you still need to find someone to design and execute it.

By now you have figured out that we aren't talking about picking a design off a catalogue. 

The concept In my mind is easy, it comes from the book _[Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)_, where the author talks about the definition of Quality, and proposes that it comes from the junction of two opposites, a Romantic and Classical view of the world. That idea can be applied to other areas, it's kin to analytical analysis and the gut feeling, to the perfect junction of medium and content, of message and form. 

This is true in motorcycles where purpose, economy and aesthetics come together in a beautiful piece of engineering, as it is in writing and drawing, where technique and creativity make sure the finished piece is charged with emotions. It is true in a tattoo where the symbol and meaning should reflect the person's values and the artist's interpretation make it come together in its execution.

In me, this relates to the analytical and emotional balance I try to keep. Because you see, I have a strong tendency to overthink and to analyse every single detail, every single possibility. This might sound cool, but it isn't. It helps at work, it helps when I am planning something for myself, it sucks in dealing with relationships and social interactions.

The analytical and romantic perspectives can be seen in some tattoo designs, where geometric and natural lines clash and come together into a beautiful piece.

I really don&#8217;t want to lose or forget about this article.

Alastair Campbell shows an amazing clarity on what Communication is about in a corporate setting and how it relates to Strategy, Objectives and Tactics.

It is a long read, but well worth your time regardless if you are in PR or any other field of Communication.

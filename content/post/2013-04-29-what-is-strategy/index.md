I have been doing a lot of reading in search for a good definition of strategy as it applies to communication. So far, most of what I found focuses on resources, goals and choosing the right tactics.

These are business strategies or military strategies. Other, more interesting definitions take into account other players and a continuous assessment of our position. This definition comes from game theory.

I have a feeling that there is something I&#8217;m missing.

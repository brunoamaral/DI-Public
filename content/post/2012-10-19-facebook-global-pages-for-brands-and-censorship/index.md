What if Facebook censored your newsfeed?

Well, it does. They call it the EdgeRank and you can [learn a bit about it over at EdgeRank Checker][1].

And there&#8217;s more. Some brands opt to have Global pages and segment their updates by region. It sounds good on paper, but there are a lot of setbacks in this tactic. Read about it over at [A Source of Inspiration][2].

Facebook is a closed system, meaning that the only way to read segmented posts is changing your location on your profile settings.

Recently Facebook announces that global you will be able to visit the page for Brand X and see only what the community managers of your country chose you should see. If a crisis breaks out somewhere else, you won&#8217;t know about it.

This gives amazing flexibility to Brands, and limits our access to information about what is going on around the world.

"Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk \nOf a day -I-ay-I-ay \nI met a little girl and we stopped to talk \nOf a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay \nAnd I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue \nAnd I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl"

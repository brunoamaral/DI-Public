"What I like about a bicycle has little to do with exercise or the environment. I like the freedom, the pragmatic aspect of riding a bike. Most of all I like the smiles. I like to go by and see how people look at the bike; stop at the traffic light and see the expression of the child in the backseat; being able to stop and say hello to a friend. Driving a car, we tend to forget that in front of us is a real person and not \"another goddamn jerk\". A bike can make us more human. Yet, if you are already a jerk deep down, a bike can't help you."

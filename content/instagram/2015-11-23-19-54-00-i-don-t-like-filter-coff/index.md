"I don't like filter #coffee. Scratch that. I didn't like filtered coffee until I was at at the Coffee Lab. Watching the care in brewing the coffee, the scent filling the air and the complex flavour of that one specific grain and blend brings back the ritual of coffee. It's about sitting down and actually relaxing, taking a breath and talking. The ritual of coffee, such as tea, is also about learning to listen and take time. It's something that the #espresso doesn't enforce. The espresso should be the quick excuse for us to sit down and sip, talk and listen. Instead, we sit down, gulp and rush away for the next meeting. Let's bring back the meaning of \"having a coffee\"."

"Stories don’t really end, chapters change. It took me longer to realise this than I care to admit.\n\nOn Friday the 13th, it stopped. It was my last day in the Neweb Project and it was bitter sweet.\n\nUnique projects don’t come often. It feels good to know I did a good job, a bit harder to move on. And it’s a relief to leave behind the months stuck in a bunker. While at the same time, it’s painful to miss the team and the jokes. Even the constant replay of Despacito.\n\nIt’s odd how we never talk about the dark side of things. How we clean up the facts to shine as bright as possible. Yet, the truth is that I haven’t been myself since June / July. \nFor the last two months I have been getting myself back. And It’s time to focus on what is in fact important. I’m taking a sort of sabbatical reflection. I’ll see you on the next chapter."

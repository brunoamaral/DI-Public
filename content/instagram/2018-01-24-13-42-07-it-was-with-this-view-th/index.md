"it was with this view, that last year, I decided to quit my job as soon as the project I was on came to a close.\n\nIt was looking at this street that I scribbled how I would renew my freelancing services. I had half a plan.\n\nThe other night, looking at this view, these memories came back. I am now working for a new company and I believe in the meantime I learned how to be a bit braver. \nYou know whatâ€™s the best way to make cruel gods laugh?"

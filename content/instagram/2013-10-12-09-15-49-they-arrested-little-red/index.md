"They arrested little red ridding hood. After feeling oppressed by outdated morals, she and Big Bad Wolf fell in love and ran away together. Like Bonnie and Clyde, both survived as outlaws smuggling firearms and drugs in picnic baskets. Not right but also not wrong. In their spare time they indulged inÂ each other and in exploring the boundaries of their sexuality. This fairy tale came to an end as a result of her love for fashion. Having decided to buy a beautiful new red ridding hood with a counterfeit credit card, she raised a red flag to the IRS and was later arrested for tax evasion."

The last few posts make up an introduction to online communication. In very broad strokes they attempt to give you an idea on how I think about the Internet.

Despite the lack of references, I feel it is easy to see it is influenced by the [Cluetrain Manifesto][1], [David Weinberger][2], [Clay Shirky&#8217;s book &#8220;Here Comes Everybody&#8221;][3]<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=relacoespubli-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0713999896" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, [David Phillips][4], [Philip Young][2] as well as a number of friends and bloggers whose work I follow.

Next up, we prove that Web 2.0 does not exist.

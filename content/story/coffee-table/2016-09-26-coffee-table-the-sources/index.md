		<p>Pinterest isn't valuable for me as a way to organize links and ideas. Yet, I tip my hat to it as a great source of inspiration and tutorials. It was a great help when I decided to (finally) decorate my apartment.</p>
        <p>And I was missing a coffee tableâ€¦ <a href="https://pt.pinterest.com/pin/425168021054090011/">Put some wine crates together and you get a pretty good one on the cheap</a>.</p>

        <p>The problem with this was setting it up to be standalone and be able to hide the electronic components. </p>

        <p>I had some friends to help with this. <a href="http://blog.loide.net">Luis Correia</a>, from <a href="http://labs.oneoverzero.org/equipa/luis-correia">OOZ Labs</a>, gave me a hand by converting the LVDS connectors of the screen to VGA. This way it can be used with any computer and a simple power source.</p>

    <h3>Wood Treatment</h3>
</div>
<div class="4u 12u(medium)">
    <p>The bare wood looked nice, but <a href="http://labs.oneoverzero.org/equipa/nuno-correia/">Nuno Correia</a>, also from <a href="http://labs.oneoverzero.org">OOZ Labs</a>, suggested treating it with <a href="http://www.ikea.com/pt/pt/catalog/products/70329051/">Bee Wax</a>. It worked great bringing out the color and the veins of the wood. </p>
    <p>The before and after photo was taken in the first day. As the wood dried out, the color improved and looked much better after a few days.</p>
   	<p>The table still needs a few aesthetic improvements. I am going to place a blackcardboard frame around the screen to hide most of the metal and make it blend a bit more. And last, it needs a glass protection on top, like a proper table.</p>

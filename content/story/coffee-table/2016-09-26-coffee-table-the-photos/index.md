<p>The coffee clock idea materialized itself slowly, it started with me taking a photo of a cup pointing to the current time. I sent it to a friend as a way of saying I was 5 minutes early.</p>

<p>That first photo wasn't really good. Some of the others that followed weren't either but I still kept them.</p>

<p>Taking the same photo over and over again is an interesting exercise. It's a way to learn how light works in different times of the day, to pay attention to shadows and to ponder different compositions of elements. In this case, the variables were simple: light, shadows, background textures.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep all the photos I took. Even the bad ones. They are still a part of the project and most of all they show how the process changed and how I started paying more attention to details. </p>

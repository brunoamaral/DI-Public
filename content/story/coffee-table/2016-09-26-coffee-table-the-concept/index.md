At first I was just posting photos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/brunoamaral) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23coffeeclock%20from%3Abrunoamaral&src=typd) using the hashtag #coffeeclock. That was enough fun for me in the time being. 

> "Maybe later I'll post them all on the blog"

This became a recurrent topic of conversation and what drove me more was loving the reaction people had when I told this story, when I showed them some of the best photos.

>"Why not build this on a site showing the time?"

Friends started to join the fun!

Building a site or a physical object to show the time using the photos became the goal. 

I fiddled with [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) for the single reason I wanted to learn something new, and the [Coffee O' Clock](http://coffeeclock.brunoamaral.eu) was born. (Node.js is a platform to develop web and mobile applications.)

The site is missing a feature to let others upload their own photo or build their own gallery. I stopped developing it because the learning curve was steep and I wanted to focus on getting a real life clock frame to show the photos.

[The code to run the webpage showing the photos is available on github as Coffee O' Clock](https://github.com/brunoamaral/Coffee-o-Clock). Feel free to use it for any non commercial use and to suggest changes.

After this was done, it was time to give it shape.

We already know what they have to show. Their skill, their view of the world and their creativity. But there is always much more that sometimes gets lost in the description of the photos, in the comment boxes, and gone forever in "instagram stories."

I reached out to a few instagramers I know, both face to face and online, asking them a series of questions so we could compare and try to see where they match and where the difference lie.

The first half is a series of preset questions, while the second bit is a more free form version, taylored to what makes the artist special.

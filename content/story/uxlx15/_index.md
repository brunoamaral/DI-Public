    <p>What follows is a mess. These are the notes I took while attending <a href="https://www.ux-lx.com/">UXLX</a> this last week. Three days packed with workshops and presentations turned out to be a crash course in User Experience, at least for me.</p>

    <p>I found parallels with things I have been doing and from the discussions and conversations that followed I feel I took away a new perspective on how those things can be done in a more efficient and effective way. It was an opportunity to see first hand the method and process that UX needs in a startup or in an established brand.</p>

    <p>So by the time I reached the second day I was taking notes like crazy. Then I posted everything on twitter for others to use.</p>

    <p>The full stack of notes is bellow, in its raw form with typos and poor format, scribbled urls and little structure in how each concept ties to the next. I am hoping that despite these flaws you will be able to take something away from it.</p>

    <p>Did anything change? Yes. I now feel more confident in taking on UX tasks and I got a foothold that allows me to dig for more information if I need to. For that, I owe a huge thank you to <a href="https://www.brunofigueiredo.net/">Bruno Figueiredo</a> and the whole team behind the conference. They did a great job!</p>

    <p>If you would like to read up more about the conference, take a look at the Sketch notes by <a href="https://twitter.com/axbom">Per Axbom</a>, and take some time to listen to the interviews of the speakers by the <a href="https://uxpodcast.com/">UX Podcast</a>.</p>

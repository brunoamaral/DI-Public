<p>Our world is full of messed up stuff that causes a lot of questions as to what we do as designers, marketing, etc.</p>

<p>A large part of this mess is information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thinking of information as material is hard</li>
<li>Information also exists from the lack of materiality</li>
</ul>

<li>tutorials</li>
<li>incentives for the user to deal with the mess</li>

<h2 id="toc_5">IA</h2>

<p>IA is the tools and concepts that help people make sense of messes made of information.</p>

<p>It is also the way we choose to arrange the parts of something to make it understandable as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Critical components of IA</h3>

<h4 id="toc_7">Ontology</h4>

<p>The capiberra is considered a fish by the catholic church, so that it could be eaten on friday.</p>

<p>Meaning :</p>

<p>&#8211; is subjective</p>

<p>&#8211; is demographic</p>

<p>&#8211; is socio political</p>

<p>&#8211; gets lost in translation</p>

<p>&#8211; is complex</p>

<p><strong>Ontology</strong> is the act of choosing the language to be used or not used within a specfic context.</p>

<p><strong>Controlled vocabularies</strong>: list of approved term and definitions for a particular context and/or setting.</p>

<p>Example of controlled vocabulary: <a href="https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/words-we-dont-say/?_r=0">https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/words-we-dont-say/?_r=0</a></p>

<p>We should start with language and not interface. Language is not just words, it can be icons, smells, light &#8230;</p>

<h4 id="toc_8">Taxonomy</h4>

<p>Where does Michael Jackson go into? M or J ?</p>

<p>Organising is not hard, the hard part is agreeing on the organisation</p>

    You can arrange information by location, alphabetically, time, category, hierarchy. And that&rsquo;s it. Basically. <a href="https://twitter.com/Abby_the_IA">@Abby_the_IA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/uxlx?src=hash">#uxlx</a>

<h4 id="toc_9">Choreography</h4>

<p>These are the liberties and constraints that you put on users to try to simplify the process.</p>

<p>How you coreograph the product says something about you.</p>

<p>If you make anything, you are probably already architecting information.</p>

This is an amazing story about an incredibly boring individual — Or is it the other way around?

It brings us back to September 2012. I had just completed a chapter of my life that consisted of being constantly divided between finishing my degree in Computers Engineering and working on the overwhelming passion of making music (see <a href="https://lazyboy.pt/">my stuff</a>). I didn\&#8217;t exactly enjoy the former but I couldn\&#8217;t make a living of the latter. It\&#8217;s not that I didn\&#8217;t like programming — I always did and I\&#8217;ve always been pretty good at it. It\&#8217;s just that I can\&#8217;t see my life as numbers and calculations, so I tend to look at computer programming and music in the same way: I love creating things in my mind and then bringing them to life.

When I graduated, I decided that I should live abroad for a while and enrich my academic background a little further. The location seemed pretty obvious: I\&#8217;d been to London before a few times and I fell in love with the city and the atmosphere (not so much with the weather), so that was my immediate choice. I completed a Masters degree in Web Development (with Distinction and with the faculty\&#8217;s award for best masters project, which I\&#8217;m legally obliged by my mom to state in public as often as possible) and the experience was amazing. It allowed me to specialise in a more creative area within computing and that made me feel good again about my education choices. I finally knew exactly what I wanted to do.

It was time to go back to Portugal, which I had learn to miss.

Back in sunny Portugal for a couple of weeks I started to realise that going back home right after the masters wasn\&#8217;t really getting the most out of the whole UK experience, so I decided to start looking for jobs in London. It was my first time looking for a job which meant that I had no expectations whatsoever. I had a couple of Skype interviews — yes, I was wearing my pyjamas on my first ever job interview — and a couple of days later I had a job offer. This was the start of a crazy couple of weeks that led to me going back to London and staying on a tiny hotel room with no windows while going to a couple more interviews, refusing the initial job offer on the last minute and accepting a role at <a href="https://monocle.com/">Monocle</a> instead.

Almost 9 months later I handed in my resignation letter — I was offered something better and more exciting somewhere else. Portugal? Not just yet. There\&#8217;s not a day that goes by without me thinking about Portugal and how much I want to go back, but it\&#8217;s still not the time. There\&#8217;s still room for me to grow here as a professional and maybe there\&#8217;s still room for Portugal to stabilise a bit more. I don\&#8217;t know when that will happen, but whenever I book my final flight to OPO I don\&#8217;t want to book a return.<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://eduardoboucas.com">Eduardo Bouças</a>, <span style="color: #3e454c;">Web Developer</span>, London</p>

> "Working on my first discovery phase, with contact with the stakeholders, there was still a lack of a method and framework. 2010 I start my own UX Strategy Consultancy. 2013 I insanely decide to write a book called **UX Strategy**."

**Business strategy**: plans and strategies the company uses to reach its goal

**Value innovation**: the primary utility of the product, the things that are indispensable. 

**Validated User Research**: "The product is not a product until you are selling something"

**Killer UX Design**: "Making something that is frictionless". It's about how hard each click is.

> I had to find a way to fit all these ideas in the book.

**Technique 1**: validating a value proposition using provisional personas and customer discovery

**Technique 2**: Conducting Competitive research and analysis

**Technique 3**: Storyboarding value innovation

**Technique 4**: Creating Solution Prototypes for Experiments

**Technique 5**: Conducting Guerrilla Research

**Technique 6**: Designing for conversion  

#### Book is released

> I was the one who wrote it first and was lucky

#### Digital transformation needs to be from the top down

And it needs to:

- Embraced by the whole company
- Touch all types of technology

In practice:

1. Build out a UI component library nd UX template frameworks
2. Look across all new product acquisition touch points
3. Early prototypes 
4. Look at the competitors in a platform level
5. Experiment new ways to combine these puzzle pieces

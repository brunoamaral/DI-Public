Time and friction get in the way in our intent to buy or donate. There is a difference between wanting to donate to victims of a tragedy in 2004 and in 2010. In the US, there is an option to donate with a text message : 90999. It's a standard donation of 10 USD. It's frictionless. The difference is that in 2010 the donations were made on impulse and reached 43 Million USD.

Donors reported they did not follow the 2010 Haitian reliefâ€¦ since making the donation.

#### Every design decision influences the user

The best way to change a person's behaviour is to change their environment. It's called **choice architecture**.

- We can influence how people **perceive** the environment
- We can influence how people **navigate** the environment
- We can influence how people **interact** with the environment

Devices have been moving from being a **Utility** to being an **Augmentation** to help the user do something.

We now have a more direct relationship with our products and services.

#### Behaviour change as a value proposition

- Self selection (by the user)
- Prescriptive (The system as a decision engine)
- Augmented ability (system offers some sort of "magic" that the user perceives is hard to do alone)
- Time release value proposition (The value received occurs over time, not "out of the box")

#### Making sense of behaviour

- Frame and measure
- Identify key behaviours
- Understand behaviours 
- Ideate and Design

##### Frame and measure

- Problem statement 
- Identify measurable outcomes

##### Identify Key Behaviours

- Behaviours backcasting
- Ecosystem mapping
- Journey diagnosis

##### Understanding Behaviours

-

##### Ideate and Design



### Influence and persuasion

Behavioural design requires an ethical backbone.

{{< tweet 999651742911553536 >}}

- Help people do something they already want to do
- Balance the benefit to the business and the customer
- Any new behaviour needs to be more beneficial than the alternate behaviour

There are also shortcuts, biases and heuristics that we use to guide our behaviour.

##### Quick Example

#### Remember O-B-I

**Outcome**: future state achieved by behaviours

**Behaviours**: required to achieve the future state

**Interactions**: that can support behaviours

For a change, I am going to bundle these simple things together.

## Code Club 

https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/ 

Here you can teach your kids a number of new things:

- HTML and CSS
- Python
- Raspberry Pi (a micro computer that can be used for many purposes)
- Scratch
- Sense HAT
- Sonic Pi

"Classes" are divided by projects, I recommend looking around for something that you think is cool.

## Micro:Bit

https://microbit.org/

micro:bit is a tiny programmable computer, designed to make learning and teaching easy and fun!

The iOS app looks like scract and does not require hardware.

## Scratch

https://scratch.mit.edu/

Create stories, games, and animations

The interface is drag and drop and you begin to learn the basics, from variables to functions and beyond.

## Thonny

https://thonny.org/

Easy to get started. Thonny comes with a quick install to get you playing around with the Python programming language quickly.

## Thank you to the Lobsters for helping compile this quick list!

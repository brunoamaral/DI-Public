Virago is a book store with an irreverent brand personality.

We looked into the audience that was already following the brand.

**Tone of Voice**:

- Agenda setting
- Classic 
- Lively 

The audience looks to them for books that challenge the status quo, and the tone of voice had to show that desire.

**Know your style**

- Consistant
- Beautiful
- Attention grabbing 

For virago the look needed to be classic and simple, but not fall too far from its values.

Know the platform

- Stories 
- Influencers 
- Hashtags 
- Trends 

These are tools to help convert people into followers.

**Know your analytics**

This allows to fly with a true north.

- Impressions
- Reach
- Followers

Don't just focus on the follower numbers, it's a basic indicator. The reach is a better indicator of your value as an instagram channel.

What draws people in is the consistency in how the account is managed, as well as the quality of the content. 

Stories can help a brand whose interaction and growth seems to have stagnated.

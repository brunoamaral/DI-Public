Social media is already a pay to play world.

**Groups and Hashtags**: are good ways to find and lure people instead of chasing them.

People in Facebook groups don't want to be bombarded with links. Instead, it's a good idea to reach out to the group admins and request permission.

**Chatbots** were able to deliver a 97% open rate for a kickstarter campaign that delivered 200k of pledges.

A good example for instagram, an account where stories are published and the lifestyle around the house is used as content. All the houses listed are actually for sale.

Takeaway: use content to build indirect sales.

Influencers make money by advertising other products and now we are seeing them put effort in having their own product or brand.

Selling on social media is like dating. You don't go on a date talking about marriage plans.

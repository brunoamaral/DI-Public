Brands on social media outgrow their peers. The rise of adblockers shows that we are moving away from the age of broadcast and to an engagement era.

Stats show that social media has a role to play, but it does not take a seat near the boardroom. Some brands do have a Chief Community Officer.

What are we doing wrong ? It's about money and understanding the value that social media has, having a robust ROI model. 

### How not to build a social media ROI model

Focusing on **ONE** business goal. Think about other areas of the business that can get value from social media, not just sales.

### Building it on your own social growth agenda

Sometimes that agenda does not match the business needs, you are building it on isolation. Talk to customer support, product development, operations, etc.

### Forgetting that social data is a goldmine

It's an open black book about your competitors, partners and customers.

What other challenges do other departments face and how can we help them with this data?

We design services and products for a happy outcome but bad news is part of day to day.

we don't get the perfect match on dating apps

we don't get results from 1 000 CVs

we don't get fit just by using fitbit

How do we retain users in the system when this happens? When the interaction is not positive.

**Dscout demo**

Did research on how people react to bad news

Listed companies that do well and poorly.

bad news come from many angles

#### breaking down *bad*

the category is not what makes bad news, and you can get responses at many levels of disapointment.

very few services design for bad news.

people we are bad at delivering bad news.

**The mum effect**: we avoid delivering bad news and we try to mediate it or spin it.

examples:

- Binder ! 
- The compliment sandwich.

##### examples of companies that deliver bad news well and bad

**Set the frame**

###### 1 minimize the footprint

plausible deniability (tinder)

better goals, progressive goal setting mapped to the user's behaviour (fitbit)

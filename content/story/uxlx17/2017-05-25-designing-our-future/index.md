## part 1 - framing

Cargo Cult UX/Design

Tribe was acting out rituals to attract planes carrying goods and food.

We take 1000 breaths a day and don't think about it. 

Same holds for the design process and our day to day job.

Our happy memories don't involve software, they involve other people.

> It's in its transparency that it fulfils it's function.
â€” James Balay

Focus on the experience and not the function.

## part 2 - culture

Pace Layers

Culture and nature evolve very slowly.

Stories are the constructors of culture. They are very close to what it means to be human.

(Harry Crews video)

- who they were the world
- their understanding of themselves
- they believed the world worked

Stories are how we understand the world and how we shape the world.

**Book** : to sell is human
**Book** : flow

students that were *Problem finders* produced better artwork and became successful artists.

Problem finding needs to come before problem solving.

## part 3 Vision

Have a vision for your future.

**Identity before effort**

And you have to make steps to make that vision a reality.

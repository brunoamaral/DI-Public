If you don't anticipate people's need, you're not doing UX.

All the attempts for anticipating the user's needs, is actually causing stress and leading to the same decisions over and over again.

Digit interacts with your bank and pulls money out everyday. It saves money for you automatically. 

## Are we taking this too far?

Problems come up because system's don't know the context of the user. It needs to go beyond what it sees in the calendar and email inbox.

Can anticipatory design choreograph our day-to-day?

Sometimes it causes more pain than good.

## Scenarios where we need to think if we should automate things

3 cautions to be aware

### 1. Accuracy 
What happens when what we automate fails?

auto pilot consequeces

- pilots only fly 3 minutes because of the auto pilot
- this means they are losing their skills

### 2. Future Innovation

who becomes the observer?

Where will ideas come from?

People can do things better and connect the dots towards innovation.

### 3. Human experience

We find satisfaction in the struggle. We get in a zone of focus and seek to overcome challenges. 

## 5 takeaways

### Do Not Invade

anticipate the need but don't invade the user's space

### Never take away full control

Always give people a way to take back control.

### reduce complexity with curation

Focus on the quality, it feels too much like an algorithm. 

### earn trust over time

We need to build trust in every action of the system

Create a system of giving input and taking away a better experience.

### you = decider in chief

know when to make decisions for your user and when to let them be the decider.

## How will you balance the line between anticipation and automation in your product?

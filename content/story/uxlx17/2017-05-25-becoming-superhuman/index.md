We use cibernetic tools everyday, from the tutorial videos to the GPS on our car.

But The user is doing all of the work.

We have limited working memory.

Every interaction with an interface wipes the working memory and the user needs to go back to recall what the task was.

Computers are dumb, they don't have notion of context.

## you're boring!

We can predict the daily behaviour of the user if we know the context.

Human > speaks > tech

That's why our systems suggest apps we use often.

IoT and other tools are beginning to understand what the context is. It learns our particular patterns.

Technology can then reduce the number of interruptions and task-switching needs.

## We can do better

Magic is skipping the right steps.

Our brain offloads stuff from the short term memory.


When tech speaks human, is when we start to gain super powers.

Spatial memory is free.

putting the task in the context helps avoid the task switching 

Augmented Spatial Memory

## Building things using a spatial interface

Reduces the cognitive burden of interacting with the UI.

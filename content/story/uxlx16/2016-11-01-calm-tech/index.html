		<p>We are all cyborgs, we use objects and technology to go outside our natural environment or be able to do new things.</p>
		<p>We are waking up next to our technology. How does that affect us?</p>
		<p>Macy Meetings in 1941 : anthropology and scientists dicussing technology</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>50 billion devices will be online by 2020 — Cisco</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>1. We live in an era of interruptive technology</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>We need a calm technology</p>
			</blockquote>
				<p>Attention is a scarce resource.</p>
		<h3>2. Technology should empower the periphery</h3>
		<h3>3. technology should inform and encalm</h3>
			<p>example: the heat sink shows the water's temperature using colored light</p>
		<h3>4. tech should amplify the best of tech and the best of humanity</h3>
			<ul>
		        <li>machines shouldn't act like humans</li>
		        <li>humans shouldn't act like machines</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Humans are good at <strong>curating</strong>, technology is good at going through a lot of data.</p>
		<h3>5. technology can communicate but doesn't need to speak</h3>
		<h3>6. technology should consider social norms</h3>

		    {{< tweet 735823405501583360 >}}

		    <p>Where are the norms now, where will they be in the future?</p>
		    <p>How will people react to it?</p>
		    <p>Google glass is not a new feature on a current device. It's a whole new device with several new features.</p>
		    <p>It was too much for people to handle at once.</p>
		    <p>The iPhone was the opposite example. Improved on an existing system, developer on boarding, limited features.</p>
		    <p>Calm technology focuses on the mental cost of doing things.</p>

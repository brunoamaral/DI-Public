<div class="text">
        <p>The biggest UX event in Europe packs presentations and workshops by top industry professionals into 3 to 4 conference days. I had the opportunity to participate in two editions, where I frantically took notes and photos.</p>
        <p>Sharing those notes turned out to be a good way to "give back" both to the speakers and other attendees.</p>
        <p>If the following text looks disconnected, it's because it is. Everything was done in the spur of the moment. Later I tried to add a few other important links, yet there's just too much content per session.</p>
        <p>So feel free to explore the notes, browse the photos and dig in to the related links on this page. Afterwards, I suggest you invest in a ticket for the next edition of UXLx. It's both a unique learning opportunity and an excellent chance to visit Lisbon.</p>
